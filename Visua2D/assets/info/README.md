# GeoMath-2D/3D

This application developed using the JAVA programming language is the first-ever collaboration between DANIEL KAIYALI  and ARCHISMAN NATH with the intention of developing a 
mathematical application that shows the audience step-by-step how to solve their math problems. This application also has numerous geometric formulas and includes visual exhibits 
of how 2D or 3D shapes look. Included in the application - users can interact with 2d or 3d shapes while exploring the numerous different functionalitiy options. A live view of 
area, length, width, height, or any other propertie of geometeric shapes will be updated constantly based on the user's interactions with the shape. Overall, this application aims
to provide a visual representation of shapes and mathematical functions so that it can be useful for students and for academic purposes. By no means should this repository or 
programs be cloned, redistributed, or published in any way without the authors(s) - Archisman Nath or Daniel Kaiyali consent or without proper permission/license.
